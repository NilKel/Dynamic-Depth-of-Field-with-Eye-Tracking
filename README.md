## Description

In this project, we intend to first generate depth maps from input video. Using these depth maps,
we plan to create refocusable videos.

With these refocusable videos, we can simulate human vision but with a more cinematic DoF using
eye tracking technology where the video will place more emphasis on whichever subject a viewer
looks at.
